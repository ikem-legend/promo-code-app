# Promo Code App

This is a single page app for managing promo codes with filter and copy functionality.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [Chakra UI](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui).

### Getting Started

    yarn install

Then:

    yarn start

Your browser will automatically open to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Changes should be reflected automatically.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

    yarn test

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the documentation about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

    yarn build

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the documentation about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Additional details and Architecture decisions

This project built primarily with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Chakra UI](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui). 
To maintain simplicity of the project, no form management or utility libraries were installed.
Manual form management and native functions were used instead.
